Legalize Trees
====================

This is a simple Phaser game made using a template. The template is based on Parcel, and described in [Making your first Phaser 3 game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game). I mostly customized the end screen, sprites, and other assets.

Use
---

```sh
npm install

# Auto-compile and run dev server:
npm run start

# Compile for production:
npm run build
```

Hot reload
----------

When running the dev server the game is destroyed and then recreated after you save changes to your files. Rarely, this can fail. Just refresh the browser.

If you don't like [hot reload](https://parceljs.org/hmr.html) at all, you can turn it off:

```sh
parcel serve src/index.html --no-hmr
```
